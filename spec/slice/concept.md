# Concept

The purpose of this page/document is to explain the concept of BREADS for those who are unfamiliar with the technology and wish to use or develop the system.

## What is BREADS?

- Specifies mechanical and electrical interfaces
- Defines power distribution and signal bus conventions
- Supports scalable, stackable, and distributed systems

## Planned implementations

- SLICE function cards
  - Single-function Logic Interface Controller Element
- LOAF controller + backplanes
  - Local Operations Attachment Frame
- CRUST interface bridges
  - Configurable Routing & Universal Signal Translator
  - Makes non-SLICE devices SLICE compliant with BREAD

## Overview of BREADS

### SLICEs

A SLICE can be grouped into 5 main categories based on it's function:

1. **Actuation**: Actuation boards (output; open-loop control function) contain the circuitry required to drive components.

2. **Sensing**: Sensing boards (input; feedback function) are equipped with various types of sensors to monitor physical conditions.

3. **Integrated**: Integrated boards (input-output; closed-loop control function), also known as multi-function boards, combine actuation and sensing, to achieve a specific the function goal.

4. **Power**: Power boards manage the power conversion and distribution within the system.

5. **Interface**: Boards to provide an interface to external components or systems, components serve to enhance or augment the MCUs capabilties and functionality is achieved via external hardware or dedicated software.

In addition there are SLICEs for prototyping and template boards.

Boards in the directory names are postfixed with an abbreviation or acronym corresponding to the **_function_** of the board.
