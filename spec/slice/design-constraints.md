| Component Selection                  | Prefer through-hole, socket-able chips for easy soldering and replacement              |

## Component Footprint Sizes

The numbers in the **Imperial** and **Metric** columns refer to the dimensions of the component package in thousandths of an inch (Imperial) and tenths of a millimeter (Metric), respectively. For example: **0402 (Imperial) / 1005 (Metric):** This package size is 0.04 inches (1.0 mm) long and 0.02 inches (0.5 mm) wide. This should give a sense of physical size when assigning footprints to a schematic.
